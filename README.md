# BI-PA2
FIT CTU - 17/18 - BI-PA2 (Programming and Algorithmics 2)

## Course overview
Students know the instruments of object-oriented programming and are able to use them for specifying and implementing abstract data types (stack, queue, enlargeable array, set, table). They can implement linked structures. They learn these skills using the programming language C++. Although this is not a module of programming in C++, students are introduced with all C++ features needed to achieve the main objective (operator overloading, templates).

## Goals
7 homeworks, which are tested against the ProgTest web system against demo examples, randomly generated data and wrong user inputs. The ProgTest web app also tests speed of algorithms and performs memory management checks. No data of these performed tests are being disclosed to students.

1 semestral work, which is being submitted to the ProgTest web system, but is evaluated by tutor.

## Disclaimer
I should be 🔥 in hell for mixing up non-english and english names of variables and methods, please, don't do the same mistake 🤦🏻‍♂️
